        <h3> Nuture</h3>
        <p> Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe.
           "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity
          is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>

        <h3>Various </h3>
        <p>Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to
          geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants
          and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate
          objects—the way that particular types of things
           exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology
           of the Earth.</p>

    <div class="box-3">
        <h3> Natural environment</h3>
        <p>It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness—wild animals,
          rocks, forest, and in general those
          things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention,
          or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects
           and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature,
          unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature".  </p>
